# Messaging and Expectations

The **Messaging and Expectation (MnE)** document is an outline highlighting several key factors to help clients build their branding identity. It is the starting place for developing the language, design/layout and visual media for their online presence and one should exist for each page in a site. **<u>This is a living document</u>**. As a clients' business grows and their needs change refer to this document to make sure messaging and expectations remain in line with their goals.

The MnE should be the first task completed after negotiating contract details and upon the completion of a kickoff.



## Elements of the MnE

The *MnE* asks the following questions:

1. What messages will, should the site deliver?
2. What is the desired outcome of the site owner (Referred to as *owner expectations*)
3. What is the information desired by the site visitor (Referred to as *visitor expectations*)


Once compiled, *owner* and *visitor* expectations are reviewed for any **shared expectations** which will formulate a new list.

### Shared Expectations

These are expectations shared between the site owner and the site visitor and are prioritized in the site design.

### Visitor Expectations

These are the desired pieces of information a site visitor wants to discover. These are prioritized over the *owner's* expectations since site traffic is the primary reason for a websites existence. If the visitor is unable to get what they came for they are unlikely to stay around much longer.

### Messaging

Messaging are the pieces of information the site owner wants to deliver to a visitor such as branding and marketing. Any owner expectations not shared with a visitor expectation becomes a messaging element. Messages are varied, sometimes being a piece of information that should be displayed explicitly or can be implied through styling, design and visual media.
