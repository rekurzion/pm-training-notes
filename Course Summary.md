# Course Summary

Welcome Leaders! The purpose of this course is to share tools to make your ideas reality using knowledge along with tried and true techniques as opposed to hope, emotions and guerrilla glue. The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) is a bible of idea realization based on techniques as old as the pyramids.

Enjoy!

## **COMMUNICATIONS**

Course schedule, documents, video lecture and meeting notes will be tracked using Asana's free tier. 

Tasks assigned to you and updates to tasks in the project will be communicated to you through email. You may also download and use the [Asana app](https://asana.com/) for project communications and task management but is not required.

Session agenda's will be sent prior to each meeting and meeting notes will be following each meeting delivered to you via email (or in Asana if you are using the app). 

All other non task related communications will be handled through [Slack](https://rekurzion.slack.com/archives/G01GK3D6JAG).

## **SCHEDULE**

Sessions will be held each week on Monday at 8:30pm with video lectures sent out the previous week. Please watch all assigned videos as they will be the topic of discussion during each Monday session.
