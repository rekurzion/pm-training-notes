# Planning and Establishing the Project Scope Baseline



*Without a vision the people perish -- Proverbs 29:18*



## Plan Scope Management

Ensuring the project includes only and all the work required in order to complete the project successfully.

> Pay close attention NOT to include what is not in the project

Everything else based on the quality done in the scoping process

> ##### INPUTS
>
> - project management plan
> - project charter (*this might be all you have at the time*)
> - EFFs, OPAs
>
> ##### TOOLS & TECHNIQUES
>
> - expert judgment
> - meetings
>
> ##### OUTPUTS
>
> - scope management plan...how to
>   - Prepare scope statement
>   - Prepare, maintain WBS
>   - Formally accept deliverables
>   - Manage change to scope statement
> - requirements management plan...how requirements are
>   - Analyzed, documented, managed
>   - Planned, prioritized, tracked, reported
>   - Configuration managed
>   - Requirements traceability matrix

## Collect Requirements

Identify **ALL** stakeholder requirements from **ALL** stakeholders

> ##### INPUTS
>
> - scope management plan
> - requirements management plan
> - stakeholder management plan
> - project charter
> - stakeholder register
>
> ##### TOOLS & TECHNIQUES
>
> - interviews (primary tool)
> - focus groups
> - facilitated workshops
> - group creativity techniques (mind mapping)
> - group decision-making techniques
> - questionnaires and surveys
> - observations
> - prototypes (building one can expose requirements)
> - benchmarking (compare to known best practices)
> - context diagrams
> - document analysis
>
> ##### OUTPUTS
>
> - requirements document
>   - individual reqs which must meet a need
>   - unambiguous, complete, consistent, **traceable**
> - requirements traceability matrix (RTM)
>   - traceablility
>     - product reqs from origin to satisfying deliverables
>   - links all requirements to
>     - a need
>     - project objective

A project's **success** is **directly** influenced by **active stakeholder involvement** in the **discovery** and decomposition of **needs** into **REQUIREMENTS**.

## Define Scope

More detailed than SOW (swag) which started the project

> ##### INPUTS
>
> - scope management plan
> - project charter
> - requirements documentation
> - OPAs
>
> ##### TOOLS & TECHNIQUES
>
> - expert judgment
> - product analysis
> - alternatives to generation of scope statement
> - facilitated workshop
>
> ##### OUTPUT
>
> - project scope statement
>   - product scope description
>   - acceptance criteria
>     - what is success?
>     - when has success been reached?
>   - deliverable
>   - product exclusions
>   - constraints
>   - assumptions
> - project documents update

Transform Requirements Document **into** Scope Statement

## Create WBS

- A *structure vision* of the deliverables
- Scope *baseline* is the basis for all project control

> ##### INPUTS
>
> - scope management plan
> - **project scope statement**
>   - best resource
> - requirements documentation
> - EFFs & OPAs
>
> ##### TOOLS & TECHNIQUES
>
> - decomposition (of requirements)
>   - divide scope, deliverables into manageable parts into **work packages** (WP)
>     - WP used for cost and duration management
>   - identify deliverables
>   - structure WBS
>   - break into smaller parts
>   - assign identification codes (for work packages)
>   - verify detail as appropriate
>   - implementation options
>     - **by project phase**
>     - by major deliverables
>     - by work package
>     - rolling wave planning
>   - include project management effort
>   - 100% rule
>     - all tasks done total 100% of the effort required to complete the project
>     - includes project management effort
> - expert judgment
>
> ##### OUTPUTS
>
> - scope baseline (official approved version)
>   - *approved* project scope statement
>   - WBS
>     - items to accomplish
>   - WBS dictionary
>     - companion to WBS
>     - HOW
>   - changed only be **formal change control**
> - project documents updates
