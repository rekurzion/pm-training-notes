# Week 1 - Project Management and Organizational Strategies

*“The beginning is the most important part of the work.”* 
 *― Plato, The Republic*

*“Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”* 
 *― Steve Jobs* 

*“Excellent!" I cried. "Elementary," said he.”* 
 ― Arthur Conan Doyle, The Complete Sherlock Holmes*

## What is a Project

- a temporary endeavor
- a definite beginning (start)
- a definite end (finish)
- finished when all project objectives are successfully met
  - what is SUCCESS?
    - when the customer requirements are met with satisfaction OR
    - *when your needs or the needs of your community are met with satisfaction*
- creates a unique project, service or result transition
- follows organizational procedures (respects the community)

## What is Project Management

- the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements OR

- *knowledge applied to action in order to satisfy the needs of yourself or you community*

  > Applied knowledge has a significant impact on success

## What do Projects do?

Accomplish strategic objectives

Or said another way

*Satisfy the needs of yourself or the community*

## How do Projects accomplish objectives?

By following the project plan. Obviously.

## Process Groups

1. INITIATING
   - how a project starts
   - where do ideas come from?
2. PLANNING
   - the meat and potatoes
3. DIRECTING & EXECUTING
   - I love it when a plan comes together
4. MONITORING & CONTROLLING
   - herding cats
5. CLOSING
   - was it good?

## Knowledge Areas

Each process group contains all 10 knowledge areas in a matrix making the 47 processes. The 10 Knowledge Areas are

- integration
- stakeholders
- human resources
- communications
- scope
- risk
- quality
- time
- cost
- procurement

## Progressive Elaboration

Start simple. Work the fundamentals. Build complexity over time, not at once.

- identify requirements (understand peoples' needs and listen)
  - ask questions
- manage stakeholders (who in your community will be affected by your idea?)
  - who is affected?
  - who is involved?
- extensive communication (be honest, upfront and timely)
- balance competing restraints, triple constraint (be a problem solver)

## Project Hierarchy

Portfolios > Programs > Projects

## How to Identify a Project

A project starts with an idea or a direct need

## Marriage of a Project and an Idea

When you think of an idea the next thought should be to turn into a project. That is, an action. An idea is meant to be realized. Thus...

> IDEA = IDEA + PROJECT

## Week 2 Prep

​    • stakeholders
​    • communications management planning

## Homework

- research and test software apps that will assist with capturing an idea. 
  - project management software can be a good starting place
  - you may need to use more than one software

## Follow these steps to start a project

1. Capture the idea or need. Use project management and/or todo list software to accomplish this. When creating a task use short descriptive sentences beginning with an action word, e.g.      

      > - create
      > - build
      > - upgrade
      > - improve
      > - learn
      > - get
      > - change
      > - organize

2. Convert the idea into a project with the following task (most PM apps can do this)

    - create stakeholder register

3. Define stakeholders for your project as follows

    - list the names of each stakeholder and 
    - their role in helping the project succeed or 
    - how they are affected by the projects outcome
    - for each stakeholder consider what types of communication that would be required
